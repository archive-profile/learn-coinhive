# Learn some coinhive for great good
This repo is just some learning content for understanding how coinhive works.
Beautify and modularize `coinhive.min.js`. It's all.
You can bundle these files by using `npm run build` but I don't guarantee does it work because I'm also learner and `blob` part is so complex.
